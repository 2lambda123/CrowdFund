<h1>Eureka Fund Terms of Service Agreement</h1>

<p>Eureka Fund is a California non-profit public benefit corporation (together with its officers, directors, agents, employees, partners and their respective affiliates, collectively, "Eureka Fund"). This Terms of Service Agreement (this "Agreement") is a contract between you ("you") and Eureka Fund and governs all transactions between you and Eureka Fund, as well as your use of the EurekaFund.org website (the "Website") and all Eureka Fund services. By using the Website, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether or not you become a donor, participate in Eureka Fund's donor program (the "Program") or otherwise use the Website (in each such capacity, a "User"). If you wish to become a donor, participate in the Program or otherwise become a User of the Website, you must read all of the terms and conditions in, and linked to, this Agreement (including the Privacy Policy)</p> 

<p>This Agreement supersedes any previous Agreement to which you and Eureka Fund may have been bound. This Agreement may be modified by Eureka Fund in its sole discretion from time to time and such modifications will become part of this Agreement and will be effective once posted by Eureka Fund on the Website. Your participation in the Program and use of the Website will be subject to any such modifications. You should review the Website and this Agreement from time to time for any modifications.</p> 

<p>This Agreement will be binding on, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Neither the course of conduct between parties nor trade practice shall act to modify any provision of the Agreement. All rights not expressly granted herein are hereby reserved. Headings are for reference purposes only and in no way define, limit, construe or describe the scope or extent of such section.</p> 
 

<p>1. Participation in the Program</p> 

<p>Eureka Fund manages the Website, which matches you and other persons (each, a "Donor" and, collectively, "Donors") with research projects (each, a "Project" and, collectively, "Projects") in need of research capital. </p> 

<p>By participating in the Program or otherwise using this Website, you hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) Eureka Fund makes no representation, warranty, covenant or guarantee that any funds you donate to a Project via the Website will result in a scientific discovery and (b) donations made via the Website (each, a "Donation") may not necessarily be distributed to the Project for which the donation was intended. </p> 

<p>1.1. Donation Disbursement. You understand that Eureka Fund identifies research organizations (each, a "Research Partner" and, collectively, "Research Partners") that are part of the research community. Any Donation made by you or any other Donor will be disbursed to Research Partners for ultimate disbursement to each Project you have selected for receipt of a Donation. For example, if a Project is being conducted by researchers (each, a "Scientist" and, collectively, "Scientists") at Stanford University, Eureka Fund will disburse funds directly to Stanford University, which will then disburse funds to the intended recipient Scientists. Eureka Fund aggregates funds from multiple Donors via the Website and passes 100% of these funds (excluding the interest earned, if any, on such funds while they are held in Eureka Fund's account, which is contributed to fund Eureka Fund's operations) to the Research Partner(s) for disbursement to the Projects selected for funding on the Website. Eureka Fund is merely a middleman in this process. In certain instances, where for example fundraising targets published on the Website are not fulfilled, Eureka Fund may choose at its discretion to withhold disbursement of funds to the Research Partners. In such cases, Donors will be given the option to have their Donation (a) allocated to a different research project of their choosing, (b) used to fund other Projects of similar scientific scope, or (c) used to fund Eureka Fund's operations.</p> 

<p>1.2 Tax Deductibility. You understand that Eureka Fund is a non-profit public benefit corporation. Eureka Fund has received exemption with the Internal Revenue Service as an organization that qualifies as a public charity under Section 501(c)3 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. You are therefore eligible to receive a tax deduction in connection with your charitable contribution to Eureka Fund. You also understand that you are solely responsible for determining the proper tax treatment for any Donation you make through the Website and the Program. Eureka Fund has not and will not provide any tax or legal advice to you in connection with any Donation you might make. This Agreement does not attempt to define the tax implications of participating in the Program. If you participate in the Program, you should consult with your own accountants, tax and legal advisors.</p> 

<p>1.3. Donation Records. Records of each Donation you make (including this Agreement and any repayment history) will be kept by Eureka Fund and, upon your request, will be made available to you at any time.</p>
